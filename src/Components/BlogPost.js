            Follow your passion! Why work for something you don’t love? Make your passion your occupation! Careers are inspired by dreams! Common phrases, common misconceptions. So Good They Can’t Ignore You by Cal Newport challenges what he calls the “passion hypothesis,” our societal belief that we should be following our passions. In this book, four rules are established against the passion hypothesis, and how to build a meaningful career that you become passionate about through your work.
            <br></br><br></br>One of the most striking realizations I had while reading came early. When you ask someone what one of their passions are, most of the time, you’ll get a response that is hard to make a career out of. Yes, some people turn their passion of playing guitar into a career, yet in reality, passions are hard to come by, and innate passions can be hardly actionable.
            <br></br><br></br>Newport focuses on building your passion through your career. By focusing on providing something meaningful, powerful, and unique, you can create career opportunities that allow you to explore what you feel you may be passionate about. In his various encounters with different successful people across the world, their stories are far from simple. Nobody wakes up one day and decides that their goal in life is to be a computational genomicist. And for those who believe passion brings happiness, the first story in the book about a man named Thomas demonstrates when expectation fails to meet reality. 
            <br></br><br></br>Building passion into your career involves a variety of factors that the rest of the book focuses on. The craftsman mindset, approaching your career by focusing on the value of what you are accomplishing, can build passion in your career. Career capital must be acquired throughout this process to avoid various pitfalls and traps set by employers. Acquiring rare and valuable skills that you can provide to your company will give you the tools you need to succeed. 
            <br></br><br></br>The 10,000 hour rule is something that we’ve all heard before. It takes 10,000 hours to truly master something. In an example comparing himself to a musician he interviewed, Newport establishes that what these 10,000 hours consists of matters greatly. Deliberate practice, exceeding the barrier of comfort, over and over and over again, is the difference between mastery and adequacy. Once you devote yourself to this deliberate practice, you will notice significant changes in your workflow, mindset, and career capital.
            <br></br><br></br>As you build your career capital, you will work towards more control over your life and occupation. However, those in power will begin to try to prevent you from making the changes necessary to gain more control. Newport argues that you must follow the “law of financial viability” to determine whether or not people will pay for your work. In your work mission, you should always stay as close as you can to the adjacent possible: barely past the cutting edge to combine ideas and explore new fields.
            <br></br><br></br>Newport’s book was insightful into the real world: following your passion is nearly impossible for the average person. Nobody gets it right the first time, especially not at 18, fresh out of high school, or 20, in the middle of college. Wherever you are in your journey, So Good They Can’t Ignore You provides insight into navigating your future career and building value from the work you do, and learning to love your work. It also has useful information on how to become a stronger negotiator and to stay ahead in your field. Reading the conclusion provided me with useful ways to use these rules in my own life as a college student, and to stay on the “adjacent possible” in my own life. I would rate this book an eight out of ten, and will most definitely be trying some of the applications Newport implemented in his own life.
